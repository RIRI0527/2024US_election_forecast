### Abstract

This paper forecasts the 2024 U.S. Presidential election with a focus on Donald Trump’s support using polling data from FiveThirtyEight. We applied linear and Bayesian models to analyze data from pollsters like YouGov and Siena/NYT. Results show Trump’s support remains stable between 40% and 50% across national and state polls from August to October 2024. Higher-quality pollsters provided more consistent predictions. While the models offer insights, limitations include the assumption of linearity and exclusion of other candidates. Overall, Trump’s support is increasing, but further monitoring is needed for precise forecasts.
