### Abstract

This paper forecasts the 2024 U.S. Presidential election with a focus on Donald Trump’s support using polling data from FiveThirtyEight. We applied linear and Bayesian models to analyze data from pollsters like YouGov and Siena/NYT. Results show Trump’s support remains stable between 40% and 50% across national and state polls from August to October 2024. Higher-quality pollsters provided more consistent predictions. While the models offer insights, limitations include the assumption of linearity and exclusion of other candidates. Overall, Trump’s support is increasing, but further monitoring is needed for precise forecasts. 

Let me know if this works!

# Purpose: To perform data integrity, descriptive statistics, and data consistency tests on the simulated polling data.
# Author: [Your Name]

# License: MIT
# Pre-requisites: Ensure the `dplyr` package is installed and loaded.
#                 The dataset (`simulated_data.csv`) should be available in the specified path.
#                 This script assumes columns for `poll_id`, `pct`, `pollscore`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `state`, `methodology`, and others are present.
# Any other information needed? Replace `/path/to/simulated_data.csv` with the actual file path before running.

# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("/path/to/simulated_data.csv")

# Data Integrity Tests
# 1. Check for missing values in each column
missing_values <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
print(missing_values)

# 2. Check data types for important columns (e.g., `poll_id`, `pct`, `pollscore` should be numeric)
is_poll_id_numeric <- is.numeric(data$poll_id)
is_pct_numeric <- is.numeric(data$pct)
is_pollscore_numeric <- is.numeric(data$pollscore)
print(is_poll_id_numeric)
print(is_pct_numeric)
print(is_pollscore_numeric)

# Descriptive Statistics Tests
# 3. Check if pct is within 0 to 100 range
pct_range <- all(data$pct >= 0 & data$pct <= 100)
print(pct_range)

# 4. Check if pollscore is within a reasonable range, assuming between -10 and 10
pollscore_range <- all(!is.na(data$pollscore) & data$pollscore >= -10 & data$pollscore <= 10)
print(pollscore_range)

# 5. Check the distribution of categorical variables like `state` and `methodology`
state_distribution <- table(data$state)
methodology_distribution <- table(data$methodology)
print(state_distribution)
print(methodology_distribution)

# Data Consistency Tests
# 6. Verify if start_date is earlier than end_date
data$start_date <- as.Date(data$start_date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
data$end_date <- as.Date(data$end_date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
date_consistency <- all(data$start_date <= data$end_date)
print(date_consistency)

# 7. Verify that each `poll_id` is unique within each combination of `pollster_id` and `start_date`
unique_poll_id <- nrow(data) == nrow(distinct(data, poll_id, pollster_id, start_date))
print(unique_poll_id)

# 8. Check for valid sample sizes in `sample_size`, ensuring no negative values and reasonable range
sample_size_valid <- all(!is.na(data$sample_size) & data$sample_size > 0 & data$sample_size < 100000)
print(sample_size_valid)

Show in New WindowError in dimnames(x) <- dn :length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent

ChatGPT

The error length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent suggests a mismatch between the number of column names specified in col.names and the actual number of columns in the data frame.

Let's troubleshoot this step-by-step:

Check the Number of Columns in data: Verify the number of columns in data by running:

r

ncol(data)
This will tell you the exact number of columns in data.

Adjust col.names Argument: Ensure that the col.names argument in kable() has the exact number of names as the columns in data. If data has, say, 6 columns, then col.names should also have 6 entries.

For example, if data has 7 columns, you should provide exactly 7 names:

r

data %>%
  head(5) %>%
  kable(
    format = "html",
    caption = "Sample Data from Analysis Dataset",
    col.names = c("Percentage", "Start Date", "End Date", "State", "Methodology", "Pollster", "Poll Score")  # Ensure this matches column count
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "blue")
Verify Data Structure: Sometimes, additional unexpected columns (like row names) might be present in the data. To prevent this, ensure data is a clean data frame without row names or extra columns. You can also check the data’s structure:

r

str(data)
Following these steps should resolve the dimnames mismatch error. Let me know if you still encounter issues!
